            <p class="heading">Analytics</p>
            <p class="grade2">After inspecting the data provided, the following basic statistics about the listings from 2015 to 2020: There are a total of 17412 distinct listings in our database spread out across 37 neighbourhoods. The listed properties are largely residential with apartments and houses being the super majority of the listings in all years. In total, during this time frame the properties have taken in $677750598 for an average income of $38,478 per property. For a more granular view into monthly average income of each neighbourhood please refer to Appendix A. <br> <br> 
                The neighbourhood with the lowest average income per month is the Presidio with $18489 in monthly rent, whereas the highest is the Mission district with an average income per month of $1778011. Meanwhile, considering the average property in each neighbourhood, Excelsior maintains the lowest average income per property at an average of $1571 while the Presidio has the highest average income with $4090 per property per month. The aforementioned Mission district ranks 25th with an average income per property per month of $2067. <br> <br> 
                While there are many popular properties in most neighbourhoods, we have chosen to list the ids of one of the most popular properties in each neighbourhood in appendix B. The rating of the properties seems to have a slight positive correlation with the annual rental income of the listings with an average of $66 increase in income for every rating point, ignoring the outlier at a rating of 49. The lowest rating is 20 with an average annual income of $13823 while the highest rating is 100 with an average income of $14654. By using linear regression to map the average ratings of each rental property (review_scores_rating)  to their average yearly availability (availability_365) from listings2015, listings2017, and listings2019, we found that an increase in one rating point correlated with a two day decrease in the availability of a property. A reasonable conclusion would be that highly rated properties are sought after more and thus less available. <br> <br> 
                Using Euclidean distance with the latitude and longitude coordinates of the rental properties, we found that the Salesforce Transit Center had the most rental properties closest to it at 6047 properties, but San Francisco City Hall was close behind at 5977 properties. As to the other two broker locations, UCSF and San Francisco State University had 4234 and 1154 properties closest to them, respectively.  As Salesforce Transit Center and San Francisco City Hall are at the heart of the city, they are naturally surrounded by more rental properties.

            <p class="heading">Comparison Over the Years</p>
            <p class="grade2">By comparing the heatmaps of the average price by property id from the listings for 2015, 2017, and 2019, the greatest frequency of high prices appeared to occur in 2017 with the highest prices centered towards the center and upper right region of San Francisco, next 2019, and the lowest being 2015.<br> <br> 
                The average rent prices by cleansed neighbourhoods in 2017 were the highest for Sea Cliff ($379.43), Presidio ($351.33), and Presidio Heights ($331.54) and the lowest for Visitacion Valley ($119.25), Bayview ($114.88), and Excelsior ($110.60). The density of listings by neighbourhood were the highest for Mission (134685), Western Addition (81030), and Castro/Upper Market (70810) and the lowest for Presidio (1095), Golden Gate Park (730), and Treasure Island/YBI (365).<br> <br> 
                The average rent prices by cleansed neighbourhoods in 2019 were the highest for Presidio Heights ($441.80), South of Market ($401.10), and Russian Hill ($368.30) and the lowest for Excelsior ($106.33), Presidio ($105.00), and Crocker Amazon ($103.89). The density of listings by neighbourhood were the highest for Mission (66065), Western Addition (39785), and Castro/Upper Market (36500) and the lowest for Lakeshore (1095), Presidio (365), and Treasure Island/YBI (365). <br> <br> <br> <br> 
                Using Euclidean distance with the latitude and longitude coordinates of the rental properties, we found that the Salesforce Transit Center had the most rental properties closest to it at 6047 properties, but San Francisco City Hall was close behind at 5977 properties.

            <p class="heading">Current book of business</p>
            <p class="grade2">The average rent prices by neighbourhoods of occupied properties have increased by approximately $110.12 comparing the most expensive average rent priced neighborhood across the five years, and it appears that the number of rented properties by neighborhood has dropped significantly, assuming the data holds accurate and consistent.<br> <br> 
                From observing heatmaps of rental prices of occupied properties from January to December of 2019, we notice January began with few properties and mostly purple (low or average prices). January to February marked a slight decline in the number of properties and remained consistent in prices, but March and April displayed consecutive, slight increases with the appearance of higher prices, indicated by yellow points on the heatmap, which continued through May. June, July, and August marked consistent declines in the number of rented properties and their prices lowered to mostly average or below average, indicated by purple. However, September and October marked a shocking increase in the number of properties and also the prices of properties began to increase drastically. At the end of the year in November and December, there was a gradual decrease in price and number of occupied rental properties.

                        Due to the exorbitant nature of rental properties, JJE will determine the price of premiums for each property based on their risks of experiencing business interruptions that impact rental incomes, such as natural disasters or power outages. We determine the likelihood of business interruptions based on neighborhood densities, property values, and the number and scores of property reviews. JJE intends to achieve low loss ratios (total claims / total premiums) by first molding our book of business to be composed of low-risk clients and then charging premiums proportionate to a property’s risk of a business interruption.</p>

                <div class="cart1">
                    <p class="major">Strategies for Business Interruptions</p>
                </div>
                <div class="cart2">
                    <p class="classes">	From the data JJE has studied, we believe that it is beneficial to have a low-density book of business to lower the risk of an all-encompassing business interruption such as power outages. As power outages are more likely local then citywide due to the structure of our electrical grid, we conclude that diversifying our reach into multiple neighborhoods will allow us to mitigate the loss from potential claims. Similarly, claims from damages caused by other local interruptions such as floods or fires can also be reduced when pursuing a low density book of business as more properties will remain untouched.<br> <br> 
                        JJE also believes in primarily insuring properties below the 75th percentile in weekly rents as higher rents mean higher claims when rental income is affected by a business interruption as the range of rental incomes is much larger in properties above the 75th percentile. As such, we intend to target clients in a variety of working to upper-middle class neighborhoods to ensure both low density and cheaper claims paid. Among the properties we do insure, we will scale the premiums proportionately to the monthly rents, so a property with a monthly rent price of $3000 would expect to pay double the premium of a property with a rent price of $1500. <br> <br> 
                        In addition to property values and locations, we realize that the ratings of a property can also be revealing in a risk assessment. If a property is rented more, its exposure to potential business interruptions is increased and thus its premium must be accordingly increased. A large number of reviews, favorable or unfavorable, tells us that a property has been rented many times and thus will likely to be rented continuously in the future, which would warrant a higher premium. Similarly, a high average review score rating indicates that a property is popular and will likely be rented more in the future as well.

                <div class="cart2">
                    <p class="classes">	Of the properties that are listed in the data, we noticed an incredibly high number of apartments, 4043 to be exact, as compared to the other 837 houses, 136 lofts, and 130 condos. We believe that this is simply the result of San Francisco being a densely populated urban city which implies that most of its homes will be an apartment in a multi-floor building. This also explains why there are so many rental properties in the heart of San Francisco but so few in the outer echelons such as Bayview. We believe that downtown of an urban city will have more rental properties as younger people will reside there while the suburban outer rings will have less rentals as people begin to invest in multi-generational homes, hence the density of rental properties in downtown San Francisco.<br> <br>
                        We also realize that there is an inherent lack of residential areas near Golden Gate Park simply due to the fact that the park is a large non-residential area. In our visualization of all the rental properties categorized by neighborhoods, a rectangular void can be seen in the place of Golden Gate Park. Another similar area is the Presidio where most of the land is greenery and landmarks.

                </div>
                <div class="cart2">
                    <p class="classes">	If we are to augment coverage with property policy, our preferred clientele would be of mid value rental properties located in more expensive neighborhoods. We expect that rental properties with monthly rent prices between the 25th and 75th percentiles to incur less claims as these properties are less likely to experience water damages or poor structural integrity than very cheap ones. Even though properties with rent prices above the 75th percentile are also less prone to claims, we believe that the risk of other factors such as natural disasters would cause a high loss ratio. We believe that the 25th and 75th percentiles are suitable cutoffs as the range of the rent within this group of properties is smaller than the range of the rent of the properties above the 75th percentile. <br> <br> 
                        Since more expensive neighborhoods, or neighborhoods with higher average monthly rents, typically have better infrastructure and lower crime rates and thus at lower risks of property damage, we recommend focusing on clients in these neighborhoods to achieve a low loss ratio.<br> <br>  
                        With respect to the location of properties, we would suggest avoiding waterfront properties as salt water is known to corrode metal and also accumulate in ducts and filters, which can be common causes of claims.<br> <br> 
                        Similar to our strategy for business interruptions, premiums for property policy should be scaled proportionately with the value of each property in order to maintain a low loss ratio.

                <div class="cart2">
                    <p class="classes">	JJE recommends the marketing team to advertise on public transportation, primarily in buses and trains. In 2017, San Francisco’s bus system had an average of 716,000 weekday boardings, and from 2010 to 2017, the BART and Caltrain ridership grew by 30 percent. These statistics lead us to believe that public transit is the most optimal platform to advertise our services. It is also our intuition that unlike on online media, transit riders will interact with in-person advertisements for longer periods of time in their commutes and thus be more likely to contact JJE. A targeted advertising campaign for transit routes in the ideal neighborhoods as described above in our property policy recommendations would be most effective at reaching out to more preferable clients.<br> <br>
                        We also suggest an online advertising campaign on commonly used real estate websites, primarily zillow.com and apartments.com. Since our business is involved with rental properties, it is reasonable to assume our potential customers will frequent these websites. In addition to the public transit advertisements, our online presence will garner enough eyeballs to build a healthy book of business.

                    <p class="classes">	In the future, JJE would like to refine our business strategies with the use of additional data. Our fundamental goal of finding the ideal clientele and achieving low loss ratios will remain unchanged but our analysis may change depending on new data.<br> <br> 
                        Data such as the history of each property’s claims, the collection of all business interruptions in the last five years, and rental information for certain months missing from the current data package would help us determine optimal premium rates and clients. In particular,  having access to data on all claims in recent years would greatly impact our analysis since it would allow us to gauge not only the frequency of different types of business interruptions but also the claim amounts that will determine our premium rates.
